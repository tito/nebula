# NEBULA: AI Personal Assistant

NEBULA is a proof of concept for a Python-based personal assistant. The goal is to create a tool that helps you take notes, manage tasks, and translate languages directly from your desktop, all without interrupting your workflow.

## Current Status

This project is in the early stages of development and currently features a basic "hello world" example built on [pipecat-ai](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat). The core functionalities, such as note-taking, language translation, and calendar management, are planned but not yet implemented.

## Installation

To install NEBULA, clone the repository and run:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Running NEBULA

Start NEBULA with:

```bash
poetry run python -m nebula.main
```

## Future Vision

The vision for NEBULA includes:

- **Seamless Note Taking**: Capture notes or screenshots without disrupting your workflow.
- **Language Translation**: Translate text or sentences directly from your desktop.
- **Calendar Integration**: Manage your schedule and tasks more effectively.
- **Memory and Recall**: Store and retrieve information using SQLite databases.
